# Getting Started

Welcome to Sikuli-D! This guide will help you get up and running with GUI automation using image recognition.

## What is Sikuli-D?

Sikuli-D is a modern GUI automation tool that uses image recognition to identify and control GUI elements. It's a Rust-based reimplementation of SikuliX, offering better performance and lower resource usage while maintaining full compatibility with SikuliX scripts.

## Key Features

- **Image Recognition**: Find and interact with GUI elements using screenshots
- **OCR Text Reading**: Extract text from screen using Tesseract OCR
- **Python Scripts**: Write automation scripts in Python 2 or Python 3
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modern IDE**: Visual script editor with image capture and preview
- **SikuliX Compatible**: Run existing SikuliX scripts without modification

## Core Concepts

### Screen and Region

- **Screen**: Represents your entire display or a specific monitor
- **Region**: A rectangular area on the screen where you want to perform operations

### Pattern and Match

- **Pattern**: An image you want to find on the screen
- **Match**: The location where a pattern was found

### Actions

- **Find**: Locate an image on the screen
- **Click**: Click on an image
- **Type**: Type text (optionally after clicking an image)
- **Wait**: Wait for an image to appear
- **Observe**: Monitor screen for image changes
